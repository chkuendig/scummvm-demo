                        <h1>ScummVM for the Web</h1>
                        <p>ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical adventure and role-playing games. ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games' executables and is not an emulator. ScummVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed. One such system is the web browser, and this demo site lets you try a selection of games directly in your browser using ScummVM!</p>
                        <p>You can play some of the games already added when launching ScummVM, or you can connect to your cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and OneDrive) and even play commercial games you bought while synchronizing saved games across devices. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main ScummVM website</a>.</p>
