THE STORY SO FAR...
---------------------
To all newly-arrived souls in the Land of the Dead, 

Buenos Dias!  Please, relax and enjoy yourself. You will probably 
be here quite a while. 

My name is Manuel Calavera, and I'm your new travel agent!  I'm 
really looking forward to helping you cross the Land of the Dead 
in style. (Not to mention on a budget!) Unfortunately, you've 
caught me at a bad time. I'm currently out of the office for an 
indefinite period, due to the fact that I just quit. Well, 
actually, I was fired. And, to tell the truth, my boss is looking
for me so that he and the boys from downtown can take me apart, 
bone by bone. I know it sounds bad, but I'm sure we'll all have 
this mess straightened out in no time, and I can get to work on 
your case. 

All I have to do to get my job back is find a woman by the name of
Mercedes Colomar, who is lost in the Petrified Forest right now. 
My boss says that I'm the one that got her lost, but I just met 
someone who feels differently. His name is Salvador Limones, and 
he leads an underground army called the Lost Soul's Alliance. The 
L.S.A. is fighting what he calls a "web of corruption in our 
beloved Department of Death." He believes that the Bureau of 
Acquisitions is cheating the very souls it was chartered to serve,
and that Mercedes is their latest victim. If that's true, then 
maybe I don't want my old job back. There's only one way to find 
out: I have to travel to the Land of the Dead myself until I find 
her.

Of course, I have to get out of town first!  I need to run some 
errands for Salvador, then he says he'll show me a secret tunnel 
out of the city. I can't go back into our offices right now, since
I'm on the lam, so I'm going to have to get what I need here on 
the streets of El Marrow. The Day of the Dead festival is going on
today, and the streets are full of slack-jawed tourists. If only I
could get one of these clowns to help me...

Anyway, just sit down and have a mint and I'll be back as soon as
I can. Just leaf through those pamphlets I left, and start 
planning your adventure. Take it from me, you're going to have a 
great trip! 

Your friend,
Manny Calavera

INSTALLING THE GRIM FANDANGO WEB DEMO
-----------------------------------------
 We've broken the demo up into pieces, so you can install just the
 game components you want or the entire package.  The "Basedemo"
 will give you the basic game without any music, voice, or 
 cutscenes (non-interactive movies).  You can add any or all of 
 these three components to the basic demo by downloading the files
 and extracting them, or you can download the "Fulldemo" to get 
 the equivalent of the base demo plus music and sound; the 
 "Fulldemo" does not include the movies.  You must install either 
 the Base demo or the Full demo to play the game.

Base demo:	21 MB download / 38 MB installed
Music: 		18 MB download / 21 MB installed
Sound: 		17 MB download / 17 MB installed
Movies: 	46 MB download / 74 MB installed
Full demo: 	56 MB download / 74 MB installed

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you decide to install the CD version of the 
Grim Fandango demo at a later time, you should uninstall the web
version of the demo first.  If you have already installed the CD
version of the Grim Fandango demo, you should uninstall it before
installing the web version of the demo.



RUNNING THE GRIM FANDANGO DEMO
---------------------------------
 After extracting the files you downloaded, the launcher will come
 up by default. If you chose to uncheck the box that brings up the
 launcher automatically, or if you wish to bring up the launcher 
 later, double-click on "Grim.exe" in the folder in which you 
 extracted the game files (default is C:\Program Files\LucasArts\
 GrimDemo). You will see a launcher with the following options:

 * Play Grim Fandango Demo
 * Readme & Troubleshooting
 * View License
 * Uninstall Grim Fandango Demo
 * Exit to Windows

 To run the demo, click on "Play Grim Fandango" from the launcher,
 or click on Lucasarts\Grim Fandango Demo in your Start Menu.  

 If you have any problems installing or running the game, please 
 consult the Troubleshooting Guide (click on the "Readme and 
 Troubleshooting" button on the launcher, then on "Troubleshooting
 Guide" on the secondary launcher).

3D Acceleration

Desktop Color Palette
---------------------
 We recommend that you set your desktop to High Color (16 bit)
 color.  When playing Grim Fandango with your desktop set to a
 color palette other than 16 bit, you may experience various
 problems while running the game.


Task Switching
--------------
 We recommend that you do not task switch while playing the Grim
 Fandango demo if your desktop palette is not set to 16 bit color.
 At the time of release of this demo, we have seen problems while
 task-switching on various video cards that can cause the demo to
 lock up or quit unexpectedly.


CTRL-ESC
--------
 We recommend that you do not use CTRL-ESC while playing the demo.


Operating Systems Supported
---------------------------
 To be able to run Grim Fandango, you must have Windows 95 as
 your operating system and your system must be 100% DirectX
 compatible. This program is Windows 98 compatible, but upon 
 release of this demo, Windows 98 had just released so we were 
 unable to verify full compatibility with this operating system 
 and all hardware configurations. If you experience any problems 
 when running the Grim Fandango demo in Windows 98, please check 
 with the manufacturer of your video card and sound card to assure
 that you have the latest Windows 98 drivers for your computer 
 hardware. MS-DOS, Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.x, Windows NT 4.0 
 and OS/2 are not supported. For more information on DirectX, see
 Section 4 of the Troubleshooting Guide.


If Launcher Screen is Too Large for Screen
-----------------------------------------
 If your font size is set to "Large Fonts", the launcher will
 appear to be twice as large as it should be and you may not be
 able to see all of the launcher buttons. We suggest you set
 your fonts to "Small" to see the entire launcher.  To do so:
 * Right-click on your desktop
 * Click on "Properties"
 * Click on the "Settings" tab
 * Click on the box under "Font size" near the bottom
 * Click on "Small Fonts"
 * Click on the "OK" button at the bottom of the window


Saving a Game
-------------
 Saving and loading a game have been disabled in the demo
 version of Grim Fandango. These features will be enabled in
 the full version.


Mouse Support
-------------
 There is no mouse support in this demo.


MOVEMENT MODES
--------------
 The Grim Fandango demo supports two different movement modes:
 character-relative and camera-relative. Character-relative
 movement is the default mode; your left and right on the key-
 board is the same as Manny's left and right. Camera-relative
 movement means that your left and right on the keyboard is the
 same as left and right on the screen, independent of the
 direction that Manny is facing.
