3D Acceleration
---------------
 3D Acceleration is not available in the Grim Fandango demo.
 It will be a feature in the full version of the game.


Desktop Color Palette
---------------------
 We recommend that you set your desktop to High Color (16 bit)
 color.  When playing Grim Fandango with your desktop set to a
 color palette other than 16 bit, you may experience various
 problems while running the game.


Task Switching
--------------
 We recommend that you do not task switch while playing the Grim
 Fandango demo if your desktop palette is not set to 16 bit color.
 At the time of release of this demo, we have seen problems while
 task-switching on various video cards that can cause the demo to
 lock up or quit unexpectedly.


CTRL-ESC
--------
 We recommend that you do not use CTRL-ESC while playing the demo.


Operating Systems Supported
---------------------------
 To be able to run Grim Fandango, you must have Windows 95 as
 your operating system and your system must be 100% DirectX
 compatible. This program is Windows 98 compatible, but upon
 release of this demo, Windows 98 has not been released, so we
 have been unable to verify full compatibility with this oper-
 ating system. MS-DOS, Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.x, Windows
 NT 4.0 and OS/2 are not supported. For more information on
 DirectX, see Section 4 of this Troubleshooting Guide.


If Launcher Screen is Too Large for Screen
-----------------------------------------
 If your font size is set to "Large Fonts", the launcher will
 appear to be twice as large as it should be and you may not be
 able to see all of the launcher buttons. We suggest you set
 your fonts to "Small" to see the entire launcher.  To do so:
 * Right-click on your desktop
 * Click on "Properties"
 * Click on the "Settings" tab
 * Click on the box under "Font size" near the bottom
 * Click on "Small Fonts"
 * Click on the "OK" button at the bottom of the window


Installing the Grim Fandango Demo
---------------------------------
 Insert the Grim Fandango Demo into your CD-ROM drive. The
 Launcher screen will open automatically unless Autoplay is
 disabled. If it does not, double-click on the My Computer
 icon, then the CD-ROM icon. This should bring up the
 launcher menu. If it does not, double-click on Grim.exe in
 the window that opens. Click on the top button from the
 following options and the installer will guide you through
 the installation process.

 * Install Grim Fandango
 * View Readme
 * View Troubleshooting Guide
 * Analyze Your Computer
 * Exit to Windows

 Installation requires 3 MB of free hard drive space. 

 If you have any problems installing the game, please consult
 the Troubleshooting Guide (click on the "View Troubleshooting
 Guide" button on the launcher).


Running the Grim Fandango Demo
------------------------------
 To run the demo, click on Lucasarts\Grim Fandango Demo in your
 Start Menu.  This will bring up the Launcher screen with the
 following options:

 * Play Grim Fandango Demo
 * Readme & Troubleshooting
   * View Readme
   * Troubleshooting Guide
   * Install DirectX 5.2
   * Analyze Your Computer
   * Done
 * View License
 * Uninstall Grim Fandango Demo

 Although it is possible to run the executable directly off of
 the CD, we recommend that you use the shortcuts the installer
 creates or make a shortcut to grimdemo.exe which is on your
 hard disk in the directory where you installed the game. The
 default location is C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Grimdemo. Run-
 ning the executable directly from the CD may cause the game
 to run much more slowly and hit the CD much harder.
