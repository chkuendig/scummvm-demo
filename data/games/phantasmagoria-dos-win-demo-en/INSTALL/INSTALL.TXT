This procedure will read your current configuration, which may involve \
searching your hard disk to find needed files.  Then it will format a floppy \
disk in drive A:, and create appropriate AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on \
the floppy disk.

Not all systems support this procedure, but trying it can do no harm.
