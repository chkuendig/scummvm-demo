                       PHANTASMAGORIA 
 
Game Strategy 

   The world of Phantasmagoria is a world of exploration, and you 
   wouldn't want to miss anything!   Look at each new room carefully.  
   Click on anything and everything that causes your cursor to 
   highlight.  Think creatively:  Sometimes there is more than one 
   solution to a puzzle, and the most obvious one may not be the best.  
   If you feel you are "stuck", leave the room and explore others, or 
   click on the Hintkeeper (the red skull) on the bottom left corner.  
   The Hintkeeper will give you hints.  You never know where you might
   find just what you need.  Turn down the lights, crank up the volume
   on your speakers, and let your imagination run wild! 

Playing Phantasmagoria - The First Screen 

1. Start New Game 

   Click on this button to start a new game.  You will be prompted 
   to name your game.  You must give it a unique name that is not 
   already being used.  For example: if you have a game named 
   "SIERRA" you will not be able to start a new game and also call 
   it "SIERRA". 

2. Continue Old Game 

   Click on this button to continue a game you've already been 
   playing.  This will put you back to where you dropped your
   bookmark so you can continue right from there.  This option 
   will not appear until you have an old game to continue. 

3. Watch Intro 

   Click on this button to watch the opening movie of the game. 

4. About 

   Click on this button to get information about the game, hints on 
   how to play, help with the interface, customer support questions, 
   credits, etc.  This file you are reading is the "About" screen.

5. Quit 

   Click on this button to quit the game.  When you quit (if you've 
   been playing a game), a "bookmark" will be placed where
   you left off.  The next time you start you will be able to continue
   this game by clicking on the "Continue Old Game" button and selecting
   the game with the name you gave it.

6. Watch Movie (review chapter 7)

   Once Don begins to "chase" you in chapter 7 (you'll know when the
   chase has started), you can no longer access the save game feature 
   in the control panel. As you play through the chase in chapter 7,
   the game is automatically being saved for you, but in a fashion 
   different than before.  Once the chase begins, there is no going 
   back.  You must keep going forward...until the ultimate outcome. 
   From this point on, your "old" saved game will not exist in the 
   same form anymore.  Instead, it will resemble a "saved" movie 
   sequence instead.   

   To restart a chase sequence, click on the Watch Movie button. It 
   will prompt you for which game to restart (based on the name of 
   the save game you were playing prior to starting the chase).
   Your entire "saved movie" sequence from the point you started the 
   chase until the place you made a bad decision will automatically be 
   reviewed. If you don't want to watch this, just click on the >> 
   (fast forward) button on the interface panel. You will regain control
   of the game at the last point at which you could have made a better 
   decision that would have allowed you to win the game.
   

The Interface 

1. The Cursor 

   The Phantasmagoria interface is based on a single cursor.  With 
   this cursor, you can fully explore and interact with the game 
   world.  Pass your cursor over the screen.   When there is 
   something to interact with, the cursor will highlight (turn red).  
   You can then click the cursor on the object highlighted by using 
   your left mouse button, and find out what happens! 

   There is no cursor control during movies.  If you wish to fast-
   forward a movie, press the ESC key on your keyboard.

2. Inventory Objects 

   Taking Inventory Objects 

   Sometimes when you click your cursor on an object on the screen, 
   you will take that object and it will appear in your inventory. 

   Examining Inventory Objects 
    
   You can examine your inventory objects by clicking on one of the 
   items that appears at the bottom of your game screen, and then 
   click that item on the EYE.  This will allow you to see the 
   inventory object in three dimensions.  You can rotate the object
   by clicking and holding down the right mouse button and then 
   moving the mouse in the direction you want the item to rotate.
   
   Manipulating Inventory Objects 
   
   In some instances, you can manipulate the object by clicking on 
   it with your play cursor.  Check each inventory item carefully.  
   It may conceal something important!

   Inventory items can be clicked on the hint skull for a verbal 
   description of the object.

   Some inventory objects can be further manipulated in the large 
   inventory window.  By moving your play cursor over the enlarged 
   inventory object, you may notice that it will turn red over certain 
   portions of said object.  Those portions may then change to reveal 
   something new.

3. The CONTROLS Icon 

   Clicking on the "P" icon in the bottom center of the interface
   screen brings up the control panel. In the first screen you can:

   View chapter progress - the bar at the top of the screen
   lets you see how far you are in a particular chapter.

   RESTORE - restore the game to the last bookmark you dropped
   in that particular game. You cannot restore a different saved
   game from this screen.

   SAVE - this will drop a bookmark at your current location. A
   bookmark is a snapshot of the game, including a history of
   what you have done and the inventory you have.

   PLAY - takes you back to the game
     
   QUIT - allows you to quit the game.  Your progress in the game
    will automatically be saved, or "bookmarked".

   FULL SCREEN/HALF SCREEN - the size at which the movies will
   play. After Setup tests your machine, default values for
   movie size and detail are set. Full screen movies are best,
   but if you find the audio skipping or the movies look "jerky"
   try playing in half screen mode. 

   UNCENSORED/CENSORED - if you don't like graphic detail of
   gore and horror, select censored mode. You will be prompted
   for a password. Once you enter a password, ALL of your games
   will be censored (even if you continue an uncensored game).
   You can switch back to uncensored game play by entering your
   password again.

   If you want the "Intro" movie censored before watching it, then 
   start a "new" game first.  Turn to censored mode, and then go 
   back and watch the "Intro."

   The "More" button on the first screen allows you to customize your
   game with these advanced options:

   TITLE BAR - if you are playing in Windows, you can turn the
   Windows title bar back on (default is off).  You must quit
   and restart Phantasmagoria for a title bar change to take
   effect.

   MOVIE DETAIL - if the movies seem to be playing slowly,
   try turning off the detail.  If they still seem to play
   slowly, try playing them half size.

   MIDI VOLUME - MIDI is primarily used for background music
   inside the house. If it is playing too soft or loud, you
   can adjust the volume by clicking on the up or down arrows.

   DAC VOLUME - DAC (also called WAV) is sampled sound. All the
   voices, outside sounds, movie music, and special effects are 
   DAC.  If they are playing too soft or loud, you can adjust 
   the volume by clicking on the up or down arrows.

   MOVIE BRIGHTNESS - If the movie detail is turned off, the
   movies may appear darker. You can adjust the brightness of
   the movies by clicking on the up or down arrows.
