    CD-ROM drive. 
  ii)Click Setup.exe from the CD to launch the installation
     program. Follow the program's instructions to install Sinister
     Six. 

****************************************************************
2. Spider-Man: Sinister Six Demo Quick Start:
****************************************************************
- Playing the Demo from Windows 95.

  You can also launch the demo from the Spider folder on you
  hard drive. Open the spider folder in Windows Explorer and
  click on SIXDEMO.bat to launch the demo.

- To Play the Demo from DOS on a Windows 3.1 machine.
  i) Exit Windows 3.1 by quitting the program. 
  ii) At the C: prompt type CD SPIDER to access the Spider directory. 
  iii) At C:\SPIDER type SIXDEMO to launch the demo. 

After a cinematic introduction, the demo's main menu will
appear on the screen. Click on Fight to fight a villain, Easy
Puzzle to play an easy version of a puzzle, Hard Puzzle to play
a difficult version of the same puzzle, and Character to have a
showdown with the Shocker. Choosing Quit returns you to DOS or
the Windows 95 desktop. 

Combat
Choosing Fight from the main menu brings you into combat
with Mysterio. Use your mouse to position the target over
Mysterio's energy spheres.  You must destroy them before they
zap you. While this demo only supports a mouse in combat,
the final release will support a joystick and keyboard
as well as a mouse. 

Solving a puzzle
Sinister Six offers both hard and easy modes of play for
both combat and puzzles. This demo allows you to sample
 a hard and an easy version of one of the game's puzzles. 
	
Easy Version
In the easy version of the puzzle Spider-Man must destroy 
the device that Shocker is using to generate a barrier of 
seismic energy. Use the cursor to move Spider-Man 
about the alley.  The cursor shape will change whenever 
the cursor is placed over a spot with which Spider-Man 
can interact. Click the cursor to initiate Spider-Man's action. 


Hard Version
In the hard version of the puzzle, Spider-Man must
deactivate a device that Shocker is using to generate a
barrier of seismic energy. You should be able to solve the
puzzle based on the clues Spider-Man provides in his
voice-over. If you need extra help, read the following paragraph.
READ NEXT PARAGRAPH ONLY IF YOU REQUIRE EXTRA 
HELP WITH THE HARD PUZZLE. 
	
The numbers on the left of each row and the top of each
column te1l you how many groups of black squares there are in
each group. If there is just one number in a line, for
example 3, then you should color in three consecutive blocks
in that line. Lines with two numbers are a little more
difficult. For example, if you see a grid line with 3  5,
this tells you that in that line you will color in 3 blocks,
then leave one or two blank blocks, then color in five other
blocks. 

Hint Feature
The completed game will feature a hint function with four
levels of hints, starting with suggestions and finally
providing a solution to the puzzle.  If you are stuck you
won't need to call a 1-900 line or purchase a clue book for
help. 

Character
Choosing Character from the main menu allows you to confront
 the Shocker. The mouse cursor will appear as a spider icon
 when placed over Shocker. Click on Shocker to speak to him.  

A conversation menu will appear on screen.  Clicking on the
speaker icon plays a Spider-Man voice-over in which Spider-Man
considers a question he could ask. Clicking on the text of the
question will cause Spider-Man to ask that question. 

You can escape from a dialogue at any time by right clicking
 the mouse or striking the ESC key. 

****************************************************************
3.  Problems installing Spider-Man: Sinister Six Demo: 
****************************************************************
If you encounter any error during installation, please try the 
following:

- Examine your hard drive.
  Windows 3.x users:
   i) First exit Windows.
  ii) Run CHKDSK.EXE or SCANDISK.EXE in DOS to examine your hard 
      drive. 

  Windows 95 users:
   i) From System Tools group, Click the Scandisk icon to start.
  ii) Follow instructions to examine your hard drive.

  If there is a problem in your hard drive, please consult the
  DOS manual or other hard disk management manual before you 
  attempt to fix the problem. You may need to backup your data 
  and other system files.

-Temporarily disabling other applications.
  If you have any DOS TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) 
  applications (e.g. virus shield) or Windows screen saver running 
  in the background, please temporarily disable it. You can 
  enable it again after the installation. 

  If you have other Windows applications running in the 
  background, please close the ones you are not using. 

-Checking your system hardware.
  Please check your system hardware and make sure your machine 
  is functioning properly. Any IRQ or DMA device conflict may
  create system instability, which will prevent software from
  functioning normally.

****************************************************************
4. Problems Running Spider-Man: Sinister Six Demo:
****************************************************************
- Out-of-memory errors in Windows 95.
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six will work in the Windows 95 DOS prompt
   window on most of the systems. However, if you encounter 
   out-of-memory errors, there is probably not enough memory
   available to the DOS environment. Consider doing the 
   following to improve the memory usage.

  i) Close all unnecessary applications.  

  ii) Check the virtual memory setting. Try to use the Windows
      recommended virtual memory size; it may help to solve the 
      out-of-memory problem. Please consult the Windows User's
      Guide for more information.
  iii) If problems persist restart your computer in DOS mode by
      selecting Shut Down from the Start menu and click the Restart in
      DOS mode option. 	

- Out-Of-Memory Errors in DOS.
  i) Determine how much memory your computer has available by 
     typing MEM and pressing ENTER at the DOS prompt. You 
     need a minimum of 8MB of total memory to use the program.
     If you do not have at least 8MB of physical memory, you 
     may not be able to run the program until you add more 
     physical memory.

  ii) Try optimizing the memory usage by using Memmaker in DOS.

- Error Message: No Input Device Found.
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six requires a mouse and a mouse device
  driver loaded before starting the game. If you encountered such
  an error message, this means either the mouse is not connected 
  properly or the device driver is not setup correctly.

- Error Message: Missing CD ROM.
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six reads data from the CD-ROM.
  If you encountered the above message, please check your CD-ROM
  drive to make sure the CD disc is inserted. Also check your 
  system CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Make certain that the 
  CD-ROM device driver and parameters are setup properly. Refer to
  your CD-ROM manual for details.
  
- Special software that is not supported.
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six does not support special software
  that assigns custom functions to the left, right, or center 
  mouse button. These functions should not be used while
  running the program.

- Creating a boot disk.
  If you encountered any EMM386 error, not enough memory error,
  or your system froze while playing Spider-Man: Sinister Six, it is
  possible that there is not enough free conventional memory
  available to the program or that there is a memory conflict
 between different DOS TSR programs.  In such a case, you should
 create a boot disk withsimplified CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Win 3.1 users:
    i) Insert a disk into the floppy drive.
   ii) Open File manager.
  iii) Select Format Disk from the Disk Menu.
   iv) Make sure the Make System Disk check box is checked.
    v) Click the OK button to format.

  The next step is to create a new CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  on the disk. You can use any .txt editor to perform the editing.

  The following is a CONFIG.SYS sample:

    DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
    DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
    DOS=UMB,HIGH
    DEVICEHIGH=<put your cd-rom device driver here>
    DEVICEHIGH=<some sound cards require you to put a device driver
    here>
    DEVICEHIGH=<some mouse require you to put a mouse device
    driver here>
    FILES=25
    LASTDRIVE=G
  
  The following is a AUTOEXEC.BAT sample:

    PROMPT$P$G
    SET PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND
    SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1
    LH C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE /D:MSCD001 /M:10
    LH <some mouse need to put device driver here>
    LH <some sound cards may need to put additional drivers here>

  CONFIG.SYS examples:

    DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
    DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS
    BUFFERS=30,0
    FILES=25
    DOS=UMB,HIGH
    LASTDRIVE=G
    DEVICEHIGH =C:\DOS\D011V200.SYS /D:MSCD001
    
  AUTOEXEC.BAT examples:
  
    @ECHO OFF
    PROMPT $p$g
    PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;
    SET TEMP=C:\temp
    SET SOUND=C:\SB16
    SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P300 T6
    SET MIDI=SYNTH:1 MAP:E
    C:\SB16\DIAGNOSE /S
    C:\SB16\MIXERSET /P /Q
    LH c:\WINDOWS\MSCDEX.EXE /S /d:mscd001 /m:10
    LH C:\DOS\mouse.exe
 
Win 95 users:
    i) Insert a disk into the floppy drive.
   ii) Double click 'My Computer' on the desktop.
  iii) Right mouse click the floppy drive icon.
   iv) Select Format.
    v) There will be a format dialog box popup.
  vi)  Make sure the Copy System Files box is checked.
  vii) Click the Start button to format.


****************************************************************
5. Performance Issues:
****************************************************************
- Defragmenting your hard disk.
  If the program runs slowly, you can try to defragment
  (clean up) your hard disk by running a hard disk
  defragmentation program.

- Improving performance with SmartDrive.
  Make sure you have SmartDrive 5.0 or above and MSCDEX 2.23. 
  This new version of SmartDrive can cache data being read from 
  the CD-ROM drive, greatly improving performance. Make sure 
  SMARTDRV is after MSCDEX in your Autoexec.bat. For information 
  on the current SmartDrive settings type SMARTDRV at the DOS 
  prompt. For help with SmartDrive type SMARTDRV/? at the DOS
  prompt or consult your DOS User's Guide.

- Tips for Notebook computers.
  Some notebook computers may be still using display,
  audio, and CD-ROM drivers that came with the system. 
  Those drivers are probably the earliest releases, and may 
  not be optimized for the best data transfer and hardware 
  utilization. Please check with the manufacturer for up-to-date
  device drivers.

  If you have Windows 95 running on your notebook computer, try
  to use the native Windows 95 32-bit device drivers for your
  sound card and CD-ROM drive. This may increase performance 
  on your machine and make Spider-Man: Sinister Six run smoother. 

- Choppy animation frames and sound.
  The Spider-Man: Sinister Six demo reads data from the
  CD-ROM. If choppy animation or sound still occurs after you
  have optimized your system, including updating the CD-ROM driver
  and sound card driver (read the following sections for details),
  this is due to the nature of your CD-ROM hardware and CD-ROM
  interface card (including sound card that comes with a CD-ROM
  interface). Some earlier CD-ROM drives and CD-ROM interface
  cards may be a bottleneck preventing optimal data transfer.
  
-Running the program through DOS
  The program may be sluggish when running through the Windows
  95 DOS shell on a 486. If the performance is less than optimal,
  restart your system in DOS and launch the demo by typing SIXDEMO
  at the Spider directory. 


****************************************************************
6. CD-ROM Issues:
****************************************************************
- Increasing the CD-ROM drive reading performance.
  If you are running the game in a pure DOS environment (not the
  DOS prompt in Windows 95), try to increase buffer size for MSCDEX
  by putting /M:25 at the end of the MSCDEX.EXE line in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

  Some CD-ROM drives came with earlier releases of their DOS 
  drivers. Old drivers may not be optimized for the best data 
  transfer rate between the CD-ROM drive and the CD-ROM host. 
  Contact your CD-ROM manufacturer for the latest drivers.

  If the game is running under a DOS prompt in Windows 95, make
  sure the CD-ROM Optimized Access Pattern in File System
  Properties is set up properly for the type of CD-ROM drive you
  have, e.g., if you have a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, you should set
 the CD-ROM Optimized Access Pattern for Quad-speed or higher.

  If you are using Windows 95, try to use the native Windows 95 
  CD-ROM driver for your CD-ROM drive. Using the CD-ROM DOS
  driver in Windows 95 may result in slower performance.  The 
  CD-ROM DOS driver may also impede full 32-bit file system access.

  The file system performance may not be optimal if it is not in full
 32-bit mode.

  Make sure that your CD-ROM drive is MPC2-compatible. An MPC2-
  compatible double-speed drive has an average seek time of less
  than one second and can transfer data from the compact disc at
  300k per second while using less than 40% of the CPU bandwidth.
  Check the documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive to
  make sure it meets these requirements. An incompatible CD-ROM
  drive will slow the performance of the program.

- Errors reading from the CD-ROM drive.
  If your system has errors reading from the CD-ROM drive, please
  do the following checks:

  i) make sure the disc surface is clean.
  ii)  Examine the surface of the disc for any visible scratches
  iii) check the documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive 
       or contact the company that supplied the drive in order
       to find out if your CD-ROM drive is functioning properly.

- Problems finding the CD-ROM drive.
  Do not remove the CD-ROM while the program is running.
  If the program cannot find the data files that it needs from 
  the CD, you will see a message telling you that your 
  computer cannot read from the drive letter of your CD-ROM.

  If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure the drive is 
  connected to your computer, plugged in, and turned on. If you 
  still see the error message after checking the points above, 
  check the documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive or 
  contact the company that supplied the drive.

****************************************************************
7. Video Display Issues:
****************************************************************
- Some VGA cards may require an external VESA driver.
  If you encounter system lockup with a blank screen, you may 
  need to run a VESA driver before starting the game. Spider-Man:
  Sinister Six requires a VGA card BIOS with VESA standard
  build-in or a VESA driver to be loaded before starting the game.
  Many VGA card manufacturers supply their own VESA drivers. You
  can contact your VGA card manufacturer to obtain the VESA driver 
  for you VGA card.  Another option is to install SciTech's UniVBE, a
  shareware universal VESA driver. If you install UniVBE and still
  experience video display problems contact your VGA card
  manufacturer to obtain a VESA driver for your card. The latest
  version of UniVBE can be obtained at SciTech's web site at
  www.scitechsoft.com or from SciTech's ftp site on America On-Line,
  AOL keyword: SciTech, and FTP: ftp.scitechsoft.com


****************************************************************
8. Audio Issues:
****************************************************************
- Conflicts with other applications.
  Audio problems can have many causes. If the game is running
  under a DOS prompt in Windows 95 and other Windows
  applications are playing sounds at the same time, this may
  interrupt sounds in Spider-Man: Sinister Six.

  Most sound cards cannot play two sounds simultaneously. In some
  cases, playing two sounds simultaneously can result in a system
  crash or freeze; in such cases, you must restart your system. 
  However, a few applications that play sounds, such as some screen 
  savers, may remove audio capability from all other Windows 
  applications; if this is the case, you may see Spider-Man: Sinister Six 
  start without any sound.  If you suspect you have such a situation, 
  exit the game and turn these applications off before launching 
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six.

- Audio driver problems.
  If you experience problems with audio, you may need to update
  your sound card driver. It is always a good idea to use the 
  most recent driver. Contact the manufacturer of your sound 
  card to learn how to obtain a new driver.

- Sounds play, but not very well.
  Sounds that are distorted have several possible 
  causes. The most likely one is simply that your speakers are 
  not of high quality.

  If you are playing sound through a high-quality stereo system, 
  try adjusting the tone controls. The 11k digital audio files in
  Spider-Man: Sinister Six will sound best with the treble control
  turned down slightly. 

  It is also possible that the software settings on your sound 
  card are causing distortion. For example, if the sound card 
  volume or WAVE file output is set to near its maximum, it will
  produce amplification distortion, just as it would on a stereo 
  system. To find out how to change your sound card settings, 
  check the documentation that came with your sound card.

- Sound does not play at all.
  If you do not hear any sounds, make sure that the volume for your
  speakers is set to an audible level. 

  If the volume is set to an audible level, check your sound card
  IRQ and DMA settings. Make sure those settings are not in conflict
  with other hardware devices. Also, check to see that the driver is
  installed correctly and, if necessary, reinstall it. Refer to the
  documentation that came with your sound card for more
  information on installing audio drivers.

  Most of the Windows 95 sound card drivers support DOS mode
  audio functions in a DOS prompt. If you are running this game
  under a DOS prompt in Windows 95, you can perform a simple test
  by using theWindows Media Player to play a .WAV file. If you still
  hear no sounds at all, something may be wrong with your sound
  card setup or the sound card driver setup. Refer to your sound card
  manual for more information on proper installation.
