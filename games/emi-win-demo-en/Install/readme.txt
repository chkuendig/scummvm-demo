If this file was loaded by the launcher, it's because the 
launcher could not find Wordpad.exe on your system.  The
launcher needs to run Wordpad to be able to load the trouble-
shooting guide (the troubleshooting guide is much too big to be
loaded by Notepad).

If you have Wordpad installed, you can load the troubleshooting
guide by going to your Start menu, Programs, Accessories, and
choosing Wordpad. You can then go to the File menu, choose Open,
and load README.RTF from the directory where you installed the
Escape from Monkey Island demo.

If you do not have Wordpad installed, you can install Wordpad
by doing the following:

1)  From your Start menu, go to Settings and choose Control
    Panel.
2)  Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3)  Click the Windows Setup tab at the top of the Add/Remove
    Program Properties window.
4)  From the list of components, click the Accessories
    component.
5)  Click the Details button.
6)  Scroll down in the list of components until you see
    Wordpad.
7)  Check the checkbox to the left of Wordpad. 
8)  Click OK.
9)  Click OK again.
10) Windows will ask you to insert your Windows CD. Insert your
    Windows CD and click OK.
11) If Windows can't find the Windows CD, it will prompt you to
    enter the path of your CD-ROM drive.  Enter in the correct
    path, and Windows should now install Wordpad.
12) You should now have Wordpad installed! You can now view
    the troubleshooting guide normally.
