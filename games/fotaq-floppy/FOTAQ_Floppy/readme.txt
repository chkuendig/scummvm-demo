	(Licence and legal stuff at the end of this file. Please read them.)

Once again, we here at ScummVM have the pleasure of bringing you yet another
classic adventure game, thanks to John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis over at
Krome Studios in Australia. This game requires at least ScummVM 0.6.0 to play.

Flight of the Amazon Queen is a 2D point-and-click adventure game set in the 
1940s, originally published for DOS and the Amiga. 

You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job of flying
Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle for a photo shoot. Of
course, things never go according to plans. After an unfortunate turn of events
they find themselves stranded in the heart of the Amazon jungle, where Joe will
embark on a quest to rescue a kidnapped princess and in the process, discover
the true sinister intentions of a suspiciously located Lederhosen company. In a
rich 2D environment, Joe will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle
inhabitants including, but not limited to, a tribe of Amazon women and 6-foot-
tall pygmies.

Game Quickstart
***************
You need ScummVM version 0.6.0 or newer to play this game, which can be
downloaded at http://www.scummvm.org/.

ScummVM runs on many platforms, including many Unices and BSDs, Windows,
Mac OS X, Windows CE and others. However note that some platforms may not (yet)
be capable of playing all games. Please see the ScummVM Compatibility List for
information on newer versions.

You should always read the instructions included with the latest version of
ScummVM, but for here is a quick three-step guide for the impatient:

 1) Unzip the game to a directory and install ScummVM
 2) After running ScummVM, click the 'Add Game' button and browse to the 
    directory you just created.
 3) After adding the game to the list, on future plays simply select it
    from the 'Game List' and click 'Start'!

Special Thanks:

          A full list of credits for ScummVM can be found in its README file,
however the following people deserve special credit... and as usual, the first
thanks should go to the creators of this game!

Steve Stamatiadis (www.spacecaptainsteve.com)
John Passfield	  (www.passfieldgames.com)

Thanks for, obviously, making a great game and giving us the honour of rewriting
the engine and releasing it as freeware.

Traditionally the next set of credits go to those who dug through the original
PC-release C source (which was a rather interesting port of the original Amiga 
AMOS version itself!) and re-engineered a new engine:
  David Eriksson, Gregory Montoir and Joost Peters.

Final credit goes to everybody else on the ScummVM team and my co-lead developer
Max Horn, who has kept everything running whilst I've been on a heat-induced
vacation thanks to a boiling summer here in Western Australia.
