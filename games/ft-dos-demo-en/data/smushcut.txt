...and I may lie...
#2
...and I may rough some people up from
#3
...but it's all for a good cause--
#4
Self preservation.
#5
You don't have much choice when trouble's riding your back
#6
Sometimes you outsmart it...
#7
Sometimes you out-fight it...
#8
...and sometimes you just have to out-run it...
#9
...full throttle.
#10
...let the throttle out and fly.
