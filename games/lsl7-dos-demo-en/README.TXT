                   Leisure Suit Larry in "Love For Sail!"

                                DOS README 


This file isn't like your normal README file, with lots of warnings about
bugs and stuff. We have none! It's so simple, you'll have no problems
installing and playing it, either in Windows or DOS. 

On behalf of our entire development team, I really hope you'll buy 
"Love For Sail!" I'm really proud of this game and bet you like it too.

                         INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
                         -----------------------

To install "Love For Sail!" under MS-DOS, follow these instructions:

1. Exit Windows completely (as if you weren't already!).

2. Insert your "Love For Sail!" CD into your CD-ROM drive. (Duh!)

3. At your DOS prompt, type:  D: <Enter>
   (If your CD-Drive isn't "D," substitute its letter instead.)

4. Type:  INSTALL <Enter>
   Note: Do not add "D:\" as with many cheaper products!

5. Follow the on-screen prompts.




                    ERROR MESSAGES DURING INSTALLATION
                    ----------------------------------

    PROBLEM: The INSTALL program fails with the message:
             "Invalid directory. Bad command or file name."
   SOLUTION: You probably typed "D:INSTALL".  Please type "D:" and
             then press ENTER, then type "INSTALL" and press ENTER.

    PROBLEM: "Can't create output file" during installation.
   SOLUTION: You need to free up more hard drive space before
             installing the game.

    PROBLEM: The install doesn't work from your second CD-ROM drive.
   SOLUTION: Run the install from your first CD-ROM drive.

    PROBLEM: Your video card's VESA driver is not listed during
             INSTALL's VESA test.
   SOLUTION: Although we try to provide as many VESA drivers as
             possible, your particular video card may not be listed.
             If this is the case, exit INSTALL, and do one of the
             following:

             a. Look in your video card manual to find the command to
             enable VESA on your particular video card.  Run this
             command to enable VESA, then rerun the "Love For Sail!"
             INSTALL program.

             b. If you cannot find your video card's special VESA
             driver program or have no information how to enable VESA,
             try using one of the VESA drivers provided on the
             Love For Sail! CD in the \INSTALL\VESA\VESA directory.
             Once you see the VESA enabled message, rerun Love For Sail!
             INSTALL program. If you do not see a VESA enabled message,
             please call your video card manufacturer for more assistance.
