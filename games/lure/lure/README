These are the files for the game Lure of the Temptress, which was freewared
by Revolution Software Ltd., and is available for download from their site at

    http://www.revolution.co.uk/_display.php?id=10

This archive is intended for use with ScummVM version 0.11.0svn 29-Nov-07 and
later. You will also require a support file lure.dat to run. Both of these 
are available for download from

    http://scummvm.org/

To use, unpack this archive to a folder, then run ScummVM, press Add Game, and
point ScummVM to that folder - it will autodetect it and the game will appear
in game list. Then select the game entry and press Start to play.
