You must have DirectX 5 installed to run the Sanitarium Demo.


SPECIAL NOTE:
------------

This demo contains video and audio that is of lesser quality than the final
game in order to conserve file space on the CD and your hard drive.

        Pentium 90 or faster
        DirectX supported PCI Video Card with 1 Meg video RAM
        DirectX supported sound card
        83 Megs hard drive space to install

CONTROLS
--------

        WALKING

                Holding down the RIGHT mouse button will cause the cursor
                to change to a gold arrow.  The main character will then
                begin walking in the direction the arrow indicates.  Moving
                the mouse around while the character is walking will cause
                him to shift directions based on the direction of the gold
                arrow.

                NOTE: You can also walk using the LEFT button if the cursor
                appears as a gold arrow on the screen, but walking using the
                RIGHT button is the preferred method.

        OTHER ACTIONS

                All actions other than walking are represented by cursors
                with crosshairs at the upper left.  You should use the
                crosshair to target what you want to click on.
            
         LOOKING
                When the cursor appears as a magnifying glass, click the
                LEFT button to hear the main character's thoughts on the
                item the cursor is over.

        USING
                When the cursor appears as a hand, click the LEFT button
                to have the main character attempt to do something with
                the item the cursor is over.

        ACCESSING INVENTORY

                Click the LEFT button over the main character, then click
                the LEFT button again over the item you want to use.  The
                cursor will turn into that item.  Click the item over the
                object you want to use it with, or click again on the main
                character to put away the item.

        USING INVENTORY

                You can tell if you can use an inventory cursor with a
                certain item if the inventory cursor pulses when you
                place the crosshair over that item.  Otherwise the
                inventory cursor will remain a static image of the
                inventory object.

        EXITING

                Press the Q key if you want to exit the playable portion
                of the demo before you reach the end.
