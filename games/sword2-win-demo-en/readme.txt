"Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror"
Additional technical notes

(1) It has been found that with certain video hardware, reducing the graphics slider in the options screen to the minimum level (i.e. left-most position) causes the sound in the game to warble and be distorted. This problem is caused by system starvation by the video card's hardware blitter. An update of your video driver may fix this problem. Meanwhile it is recommended that you set the graphics level to one of the higher positions.

(2) The system profiler may report "No Audio Hardware" if you install "Broken Sword II" whilst another program has control of the sound card. Similarly if you start the game whilst another application is using the sound card, you will not hear any sound in the game. It is recommended that you close all other applications before installing & playing "Broken Sword II".
