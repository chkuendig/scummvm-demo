2. Introduction
===============

Thanks for installing The Longest Journey demo! You're about to
take a voyage across the Great Sea of Arcadia, from the port city
of Marcuria to (hopefully) the island of Alais. The chapter you're
about to play is the sixth chapter, and April, the lead character
and your alter ego, needs to get to the island of Alais as soon as
possible. Telling more would be giving the story away, but rest
assured that there's plenty to see and to do in this demo! And if
you like what you see, and you want to find out what happens next,
keep your eyes open for the release of The Longest Journey in a
store near you!

5. Playing the Game
===================

The left mouse button is used for interacting with the environment
in a number of ways. Left-clicking anywhere on the screen moves
April as close to that point as possible.  Double-clicking the left
button makes April run.  Clicking on a highlighted spot on the
screen usually brings up a floating menu.  Clicking on one of the
icons on that menu prompts April to interact with the object.
Double clicking on the same icon forces April to run (if necessary)
to the object before interacting with it.

In addition, the right mouse button (RMB) is used for the following
actions: move the mouse inside the dialogue window and click RMB to
skip the current sentence.  Clicking the RMB in the game window opens
or closes the inventory.  If you are holding an item and click RMB,
the item will be put back in your inventory.

7. Troubleshooting
===================

This section assumes that your computer is plugged in (like, duh!),
that the power is on, and that you are running one of the operating
systems listed in "System Requirements".  In other words, time to
upgrade from DOS.  It also assumes that your computer hardware
equals or surpasses the minimum requirements listed in "System
Requirements".

The most common reason why a game doesn't work properly is due to
old drivers.  Make sure you're using the latest drivers for your
video- and sound-card, and that you've installed the latest version
of DirectX.


7.1. Installer / Startup-problems:

 PROBLEM: The game does not start. A message pops up telling me that
          one or more files are missing and that I need to re-install.
   CAUSE: The paths pointing to the game data have not been set or
          are incorrect.
SOLUTION: You need to re-install the game to correct this problem.

 PROBLEM: During the installation process a message pops up, telling you that
          the game doesn't necessary work with windows NT.
   CAUSE: The Longest Journey needs DirectX 6.1 or better and control over the 
          sound hardware to run. This is usually not supported in windows NT.
SOLUTION: Run the game on a computer with Windows 95 or Windows 98. If you think you
          can make the game run on NT anyway, you are welcome to try it, but we will
          not give any support on it...
  SYSTEM: Any machine running on Windows NT.


7.2. Graphic-related problems:

 PROBLEM: The shadows cast by the characters in the game flicker or
          look strange.
   CAUSE: Your 3D hardware has very high Z-buffer resolution.
SOLUTION: Make sure you have the latest drivers for your 3D video-card
          installed. On the Hardware Setup menu, press the "Advanced"
          button.  Under "Troubleshooting" turn on the "Force Single
          Buffer" option.
HARDWARE: Creative Graphic Blaster Riva TNT; Creative 3D Blaster Riva
          TNT2/TNT2 Ultra.

 PROBLEM: The 3d characters dissapear, or are only paritally rendered. 
          For instance Aprils legs dissapear
   CAUSE: Your new drivers for the 3d hardware card does things 
          differently than the drivers we tested the game with.
SOLUTION: Turning off shadows in the in game options menu should remove
          the problem as well as the shadows.
          Alternative solution: Reinstall older drivers.
HARDWARE: Creative Graphic Blaster Riva TNT; Creative 3D Blaster Riva
          TNT2/TNT2 Ultra.

 PROBLEM: No characters cast shadows, even if this option has been
          enabled from the Game Settings screen.
   CAUSE: Your selected video-card is reporting that it supports
          W-buffer, even though it doesn't.
SOLUTION: Update your video-card driver by visiting the card vendor's
          homepage. If this doesn't help, click the "Advanced" button
          in the Hardware Setup dialogue, and deselect the checkbox
          labeled "Enable W-Buffer" under "Troubleshooting".
HARDWARE: Creative 3D Blaster Savage 4

 PROBLEM: April has no face.
   CAUSE: The video-card you're running "The Longest Journey" on 
          doesn't support texture-mapping.
SOLUTION: Select another video-card from the Hardware Setup dialogue
          that appears automatically every time you start "The Longest
          Journey". If there are no other 3D video-cards on your 
          computer, try running the game in software mode by deselecting
          the "Enable 3D Acceleration" checkbox. Warning; this may
          make the game appear choppy and slow, and you should
          consider upgrading your video-card.
HARDWARE: Older 3D graphics accelerator cards.

 PROBLEM: Characters in the game look like they have been turned
          inside out.
   CAUSE: Your selected video-card is reporting that it supports
          W-buffer, even though it doesn't.
SOLUTION: Update your video-card driver by visiting the card vendor's
          homepage. If this doesn't help, click the "Advanced" button
          in the Hardware Setup dialogue, and deselect the checkbox
          labeled "Enable W-Buffer" under "Troubleshooting".
HARDWARE: 3Dfx Voodoo 3

 PROBLEM: The game runs in a small rectangle in the upper left of your
          monitor.
   CAUSE: The game is not able to switch to full-screen mode in a
          proper fashion.
SOLUTION: Update your drivers.
HARDWARE: 3Dfx Voodoo 3

 PROBLEM: 32-bit colour depth is not available from the list in the
          Hardware Setup dialogue.
   CAUSE: Your video-card doesn't support 32-bit true color mode, or
          it doesn't have enough memory to run "The Longest Journey"
          in 32-bit true color.
SOLUTION: Select another video-card (if available) from the Hardware
          Setup dialog, or run the game in 16-bit colour instead.
HARDWARE: 3Dfx Voodoo 1, 2 and 3

 PROBLEM: The trains and the flying cars are flickering, and appear in
          front of everything else on the screen when they shouldn't.
   CAUSE: Double-buffering doesn't work properly with your currently
          selected 3D video-card.
SOLUTION: Click the "Advanced" button in the Hardware Setup dialogue,
          and turn "Force Single Buffer" on by enabling the checkbox.
HARDWARE: Matrox Millennium G200 AGP

 PROBLEM: When I move the cursor around, it leaves a trail on the
          screen.
   CAUSE: Your video-card has been set up to ignore the "Wait for
          VSYNC" command.
SOLUTION: This may differ from card to card, but one example solution
          (for the Creative Graphics Blaster Riva TNT) is as follows:
          Open Display Properties (Control Panel\Display), select
          BlasterControl-> Tweak-> Advanced Settings, and make sure
          that the check-box "Wait for VSYNC" is enabled.  If you are
          using the Nvidia RIVA TNT Detonator Drivers, you might not
          be able to turn on "Wait for VSYNC".  To fix the problem,
          either change back to the official Creative Labs drivers,
          or run the game in software rendering mode.  Alternatively,
          contact your card's vendor and ask them how to enable "Wait
          for VSYNC".
HARDWARE: Creative Graphics Blaster Riva TNT

PROBLEMS: The text on the main-menu and/or in the game have a magenta
          colour, and look garbled.
   CAUSE: Window's automatic font-smoothing isn't perfect.
SOLUTION: Go to Display Properties, select the "Effects" tab and
          uncheck "Smooth edges of screen fonts".
HARDWARE: No particular hardware.

 PROBLEM: When I click on "End the Journey" in the main menu, the game
          seems to lock up, and the display looks messed up.
   CAUSE: You're using two video-cards in SLI (Scan Line Interleave)
          mode, and the driver for your cards isn't able to display
          the message-boxes.
SOLUTION: Turn off the SLI mode in Display->Properties->[GfxCard]->
          Advanced Settings.  You should now be able to see the
          message-boxes.
HARDWARE: Graphics cards that run in SLI mode (Voodoo 1 / Voodoo 2).


7.3. Sound-problems:

 PROBLEM: A message pops up when the game starts, saying you may
          experience degraded sound quality.
   CAUSE: The drivers for your soundcard are not DirectX certified.
SOLUTION: The game may still run flawlessly, but if it doesn't,
          contact your sound-card's hardware vendor and inquire about
          updated drivers.
HARDWARE: Very new or very old soundcards.


7.4. General problems:

 PROBLEM: The game is really choppy.
   CAUSE: Your system may not fulfill all hardware requirements.
          "The Longest Journey" requires a 166-MMX Pentium to run at
          all, and it prefers a much faster CPU to run optimally.
SOLUTION: A 3D graphics accelerator may help performance, as will
          more RAM, a faster hard-disk, or a faster CPU.
HARDWARE: Slow systems.

 PROBLEM: The game stops with the message "Out of Memory".
   CAUSE: You don't have enough space on the hard-drive where the
          Windows swap-file resides.
SOLUTION: Free up some space on the drive where the Windows swap-file
          is located (normally the C:\ drive) and start the game again.
HARDWARE: No specific hardware.
