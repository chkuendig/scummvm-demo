-- This is the text file LINGO.INI.  It is designed
-- to tell Director Player for Windows what XObjects or
-- DLLs should be loaded when starting DPW.EXE.

-- You should have a copy of this file and the associated
-- DLL file (for example, FILEIO.DLL or DPWQTW.DLL) in 
-- the same location as any Projector you wish to distribute.
-- Otherwise, the Projector will not be able to utilize
-- the features of the DLL you want to use.

-- To comment out one of the lines below, use two dashes (--)
-- as in the beginning of these lines.

-- The three DLLs or XObjects loaded are:
-- FILEIO.DLL, for file input and output
-- DPWQTW.DLL, for use with QuickTime for Windows (MOV) files
-- DPWAVI.DLL, for use with Video for Windows (AVI) files
